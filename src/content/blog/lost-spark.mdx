Recently I came to the conclusion that I was burnt out. If you're looking for a medical study on burnout this probably is not for you. 

Instead I just intend to speak on what happened, and what I'm going to do going forward so hopefully someone won't have to repeat the same mistakes. 

## ~10 Years Ago
Like many, games was my avenue into programming. What started as a curiosity into comics, 3D animations (Minecraft animations were popping off at the time) and a love of playing games turned into a passion for building software.

At the time I wouldn't have said **I love programming**, instead I would've likely said:
- I love building this game
- What new can I add to this
- This is actually quite fun to play, can I be the best in the world at my game?

There was an innocense to it all. Before Unity C# Game Development I had a short stint with Web dev as a result of my Further Math studying older brother (of 6 years) cohercing me into building a solar system portfolio page with him. 

At the time what was a Adobe After Affects logo animation playing in the centre of a black screen with various shapes & text all rotating around the centre using the standard elipse equaltion felt like to me what quantum computing feels like to me today.

I don't get it, and quite frankly at the time I didn't want to get it. It wasn't satisying. I had concluded that Web dev wasn't for me. Until I spent over a year working on the same game only to realise no one would donwload it from the app store. Although I was happy with what I created I knew this wasn't going to be the simplest career. I think i was correct on that one.

So instead I went back to web dev, and had a go seeing how pretty I could make sites, even attempting to do some freelance and coldcall to get clients. i failed miserably at the latter however become quite aware of my reasonable design ability which paired with my analytical thinking was huge.

I would try new libraries and get excited and the new things which were possible just like that. As much as Bootstrap may have not aged the finest, what it did for me was show me how beautiful a site could look like with such minimal amount of code. There were ways to opt-in to abtractions and leave behind the complexity. 

So when did it begin to change?

## University

After joining University it was clear to me that I was going to be a Software Engineer, but now I actually had to put things in place to make it a reality. Although I did well in projects, I still considered
