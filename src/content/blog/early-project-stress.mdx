Starting a new project *should* be exciting — a chance to explore new ideas, solve meaningful problems, and build something valuable. But too often, that excitement is replaced by frustration, misalignment, and inefficiency.

Recently, after wrapping up loose ends from older projects, I began two new ones:

1. **A custom CMS (Content Management System)** — something I’d wanted to build since starting my current job.
2. **A Social Media Automation Tool** — a project that brings together several components I’ve been eager to work on.

I usually begin new projects by asking two questions:

1. What is the current problem?  
2. What can be done to solve part of it?

Simple enough — but identifying the "problem" is rarely straightforward.

## The Problem with Identifying Problems

In theory, we solve problems. In practice, it's often unclear what the real problem is — or whether one exists at all. Common challenges I’ve encountered include:

- Vague problem descriptions — usually shared verbally or through unstructured text  
- A lack of quantifiable evidence — no data to show the size or urgency of the issue  
- No clear success criteria — so even if we build something, we don’t know if it helped  
- Misattributed problems — one team claims another team is struggling, but that team doesn’t agree  

This creates a messy feedback loop. For example, someone says, “We’re not producing enough content,” followed by, “Let’s make producers more efficient.” Reasonable on the surface — until you ask the producers and they don’t believe their tools are the problem.

At that point, you’re not just building a system; you’re building based on misalignment. The real issue might be:

- Communication gaps  
- Strategic missteps  
- Understaffing  
- Lack of training  
- Or simply burnout  

A new tool can’t fix those — and worse, it can add new problems if it’s adopted without buy-in, proper onboarding, or clear metrics for success.

## The Harsh Reality

Inside any organisation, knowledge should be represented in a way that is easy to find, digest, update, and track over time. Often, platforms aren't the main culprit behind poor implementations — people and processes are.

A good user-managed system should allow you to:

1. **Quickly find** what you're looking for – This depends on the wisdom and structure provided by the content creator.  
2. **Easily understand** what you find – This relies on the clarity and communication style of whoever created or edited the content.  
3. Require **minimal effort to update** – This is a mix of good process enforcement and intuitive system design.  
4. Show a clear **change history** – Including what was changed, when, why, and by whom — assuming users use the system correctly.

### A Real Example of Dysfunction

Let’s say one of our products — we’ll call it **Lego Weekly** — goes through a rebrand. New colours, new logo, new assets.

But...

- Has the **Knowledgebase** been updated? No.  
- Has a **project board** (like in Monday.com or Jira) been created to document the change and its consequences? No.  
- Are all affected team members aware of the update? No.  

The result? A **sponsor presentation** is created using the old branding and sent to a client.

At first glance, the issue might seem simple: *"The designer used the wrong logo."*  
But whose fault is it really? The correct answer: **everyone and no one.**

- The **branding team** doesn’t have a clear way to identify all the ripple effects of their change. Even if they flag it, follow-through isn’t always their responsibility — and they’re likely under time pressure.  
- The **web team** implemented what was asked. Anticipating cross-team impact isn’t always in their remit.  
- The **presentation creator** trusted the knowledgebase — perhaps naively — assuming it was up to date.

This kind of disconnect happens across teams *every single day*. And the result?  
Stress. Apathy. Frustration.

### Is There Hope?

Absolutely.

It’s important to adapt to the company you're in. Some teams need more process, structure, and designated staff to maintain systems. But what if there’s no budget for that?

Do we accept inefficient workflows, growing staff dissatisfaction, cross-team tension, and a declining product?

**Hell no.**

Instead, we build **dumb systems** — systems that are compatible with human laziness.

Rather than expecting people to update a complex, book-style knowledgebase, we could:

- Use a Slack bot that emails relevant teams:  
  `@email:all Hey, new Lego Weekly logo is out.`  
- Or build an AI-powered knowledgebase that lets you paste:  
  `"Here is the new Lego Weekly logo"`  
  ...and later find it with a question like:  
  `"What is the current Lego Weekly logo?"`

These aren’t trivial builds. But they represent the kind of **smart automation** we should invest in — especially for problems where humans consistently fall short or disengage.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to justify these efforts when time and energy are being poured into building **tools for non-issues**.

Let’s stop solving problems that don’t exist — and start solving real ones in smarter ways.

## What We Need to Do Better

Before jumping into building a new thing, we should consider the following:

- **Invest in processes** – Don’t just invest in new tools. Sometimes the tool isn’t broken — the process is. Solutions may come in the form of better workflows, clearer ownership, or simply more training.  
- **Talk to users** – Not just stakeholders. Talk to the actual users. Understand their pain points. Build with them, not just for them.  
- **Quantify success** – Measure the current baseline and define what improvement looks like. If we don’t know what “better” means, we won’t know when we’ve gotten there.  
- **Support adoption** – A tool isn’t done when it’s built. Rollout, onboarding, integration into daily workflows — all critical for success.

## Final Thoughts

Early-stage project development doesn't have to be tragic. But unless we do the groundwork — clearly define problems, talk to users, measure outcomes, and support change — we’re setting ourselves up to solve the wrong things, or worse, create new ones.

Let’s make starting something new feel exciting again — not exhausting.
